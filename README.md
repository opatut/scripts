# Various scripts

This repository contains a few scripts that may do useful things for you if applied properly. But I probably won't document how to apply them properly, find out yourself!

## Wallpyper

Switches wallpaper, managing them in 'collections'. Run as user, bind to keys. Depends on **feh**.

Symlink or copy to $PATH.

## Dogecoin

Fetches current dogecoin value and bitcoin values from different sources and calculates DOGE/USD. Easily adjustable to display more information or a different conversion. Useful for conky!
